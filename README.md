# US Startups 

A small project in which I take a look at funding statistics for US Startups to find the best type of company to startup.

Extraction

Through Kaggle, I found a good starting point using the dataset StartUp Investments (Crunchbase), detailing many forms of investments made to startups 
and how much each specific one was.  From there, I mainly wanted to focus on total investments to find out what companies were getting the most funding.

As shown in this graph, the top 3 markets that are being funded in the US are Biotech, Mobile, and Software.

In this graph, the vast majority of startups, well, start up in the San Francisco Bay Area in California.  New York and Boston trail behind 
with less than half of the startups present in California.
